As part of our class called "StratoScience Lab," 1 of our students are tested UV light levels to infer the presence of ozone in the atmosphere, and the other is measuring wind levels and the power generated from it.

As this will be flying on our next high altitude balloon, titled, "HABGab 2023", we need to conserve power and weight coming from batteries.
This Arduino sketch combines code that reads from UV sensors, a GPS module (to get altitude readings) sensor, and a wind experiment that uses analog pins to measure voltage and watts from a motor on the payload cord.

THe GPS module measures altitude to also trigger two of our cutdown systems to release 2 student projects, a glider and an unpowered helicopter from the payload.
